# Carbon App

## Introduction
The mobile app developed for this thesis is designed to help users track and reduce their personal carbon emissions. It provides a user-friendly interface and features that allow users to monitor their carbon footprint, set goals, and receive personalized recommendations for reducing their environmental impact.

## Features
1. User Registration and Login: The app allows users to create an account and securely log in to access their personalized data.

2. Carbon Emissions Tracking: Users can log their daily activities and consumption habits that contribute to carbon emissions, such as transportation, energy usage, food choices, and more. The app calculates the carbon emissions associated with each activity based on predefined metrics.

3. Dashboard: The app presents users with a dashboard that displays an overview of their carbon emissions, progress towards goals, and personalized tips for reducing emissions.

4. Personalized Recommendations: Based on users' logged activities and goals, the app generates personalized recommendations for reducing carbon emissions. These recommendations can include eco-friendly alternatives, energy-saving tips, sustainable product suggestions, and more.

5. Data Visualization: The app provides visual representations, such as progress bars and charts, to help users understand their carbon footprint trends over time and identify areas where they can make significant reductions.

## Technology Stack
The mobile app is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React Native, Node.js) stack, which combines powerful technologies to deliver a comprehensive solution. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is chosen for its flexibility and scalability, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of user data. Mongoose.js, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, is integrated with MongoDB to provide a structured and intuitive way of interacting with the database.

Express, a fast and minimalist web application framework, is utilized for building the backend server, handling HTTP requests, and implementing the app's business logic. It simplifies the development process and enables efficient routing and middleware management.

React Native, a popular JavaScript framework, is employed for frontend development, allowing the app to run natively on both iOS and Android platforms. With its component-based architecture and reusable UI elements, React Native ensures code efficiency and maintainability, while providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime environment, powers the backend of the mobile app, enabling efficient handling of concurrent requests, real-time communication, and seamless integration with other components of the MERN stack.

## Conclusion
The mobile app developed for this thesis aims to empower users to make informed choices and take actionable steps towards reducing their carbon emissions. By providing tracking, goal setting, personalized recommendations, and data visualization, the app encourages users to adopt sustainable practices and contribute to a greener future. Leveraging the MERN stack and its associated technologies, the app delivers a robust and scalable solution that combines the power of MongoDB, Express, React Native, and Node.js. Through this technological foundation, the app offers a seamless user experience, cross-platform compatibility, and efficient data management.
